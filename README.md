## A Simple Project proposal
This simple [project propoal](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/Poster%2010AUG18.pdf) was created for my first class at Bellevue University. Please note it is only a proposal and not compled a project.

This [presentation](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/National%20Retail%20Sales.pdf) shows how to accomplish that in R Studio. The [R Studio code](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/Retail%20Project.R) is avaible here if you're curious.
