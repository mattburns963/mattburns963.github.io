## Welcome to the Project Respository for Matt Burns!

This repository contains both completed projects as well as the code behind the projects.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Poster 10AUG18.pdf

This simple [project propoal](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/Poster%2010AUG18.pdf) was created for my first class at Bellevue University. Please note it is only a proposal and not compled a project.

Curious about retail sales and how to forecast them? This [presentation](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/National%20Retail%20Sales.pdf) shows how to accomplish that in R Studio.


Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
