## This repository contains academic projects completed in pursuit of my MSDS from Bellevue University.

### <i class="fa fa-shopping-cart fa-3x"></i> Retail Sales Forecast in R
Curious about retail sales and how to forecast them? This [presentation](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/National%20Retail%20Sales.pdf) shows how to accomplish that in R Studio. The [R Studio code](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/Retail%20Project.R) is avaible here if you're curious.

### <i class="fa fa-beer fa-3x"></i> State Taxation
Do you pay a lot of taxes in your state? Check out this [markdown file](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/Final_M_D%20Verbiage.docx)to see how to get that answer. 

*Spoiler alert:* California, Texas, New York and Florida are the outliers.

<br/><br/>
### <i class="fa fa-beer fa-2x"></i> Stock Price Volatility
Tired of pretending to understand your friend when they babble about their latest option investment? So was I! Before one can start learning about “the Greeks” of options pricing, they need to understand volatility. These files will show how to pull stock prices at 30 minutes variables and how they vary over time.  The code for pulling the data is [here](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/StockPull.py) and the cluster analysis is right [here](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/kmeans.R). Wanna cut to the chase? Here’s the [report](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/Stock%20Volatility%20White%20Paper%2027SEP20.docx) and here’s the [presentation](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/Stock%20Volatility%20Presentation.pdf).

<br/><br/>
### <i class="fa fa-car fa-2x"></i> Lost Auto Sales
In 2Q20 the economy was shut down for all intents and purposes. This [report](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/Auto%20white%20paper%2027OCT20.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/Auto%20presentation.pdf) quantify how many auto sales were lost during this period. This [code](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/AutoSales.R) for RStudio shows how it can be done.

<br/><br/>
### <i class="fa fa-flag fa-2x"></i> Congressional Reapportionment
This country spends a lot of money on a census to properly apportion congressional seats and allocate the budget. How can this be done without actually counting every citizen? There’s a [report](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/Reapportionment%20Report%20P3%2020NOV20.pdf) and a [presentation](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/Reapportionment.pdf) for your review. If you’d like to see how easy this is to do in RStudio, click [here](https://github.com/mattburns963/680/blob/master/Apportionment.R).

<br/><br/>
### <i class="fa fa-fire fa-2x"></i>Natural Gas vs Employment
The project included EDA of the data relating to natural gas prices and unemployment in th emining sector. If one is curious about the impact of the lower gnatual gfas prices has on employment they can view this [presentation](https://github.com/mattburns963/530/blob/master/Gas%20Prices%20vs%20Unemployment.pdf) and use this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mattburns963/530/blob/master/Burns%20530%20Final%20Project.ipynb) to get started.

<br/><br/>
### <i class="fa fa-beer fa-2x"></i>  One has to start somewhere
I created this simple [project propoal](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/Poster%2010AUG18.pdf) for my first class at Bellevue University. Please note it is only a proposal and not compled a project.

In my first programming class I manipulated data and create a simple markdown file. Click [here](https://github.com/mattburns963/msds510/blob/master/beer.pdf) if you want to know which country drinks the most beer per capita.

### <i class="fa fa-plane fa-2x"></i>Two Airline Visualizations
I made two visualizations on the same topic, airline saftey. [This one](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/Airline%20Safety%202.0.pdf) is packed with figures and graphs, while [this one](https://github.com/mattburns963/mattburns963.github.io/blob/master/Airline%20Safety%20Infographic.pdf) is for our non-math friends.
